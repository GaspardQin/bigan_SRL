Testing BIGAN (Adversarial Feature Learning) for State Representation Learning


This is a PyTorch implementation of a BIGAN Network described in the paper "Adversarial Feature Learning" by J. Donahue, P. Krahenbuhl, T. Darrell.

This program will be tested on datasets from "Learning State Representations with Robotic Priors" (Jonschkowski & Brock, 2015),
